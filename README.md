# NU SCRIPT Study REDCap Instruments

## Clinical Study

The files to recreate the REDCap project used to capture clinical information are in the `clinical_*.csv` files. Additionally you will need to make the following instruments repeatable

|Event|Instrument|Type|
|---|---|---|
|Baseline|Repeat Instruments|`Bal Sample` , `Blood Sample Type`|
|Pneumonia Episode|Repeat Instruments|`Pneumonia Episode Category`,`Pneumonia Episode Outcome`|
|Bal|Repeat Instruments|`Bal Sample` , `Blood Sample Type`|

## Sample Analysis

The files to recreate the REDCap project used to capture sample analysis information are in the 'sample_*.csv' files. There are no events in this projects but you will need to make the following instruments repeatable.
